            <h2>About My Path This Quarter</h2>
            <p>At the beggining of the Quarter I was super lost with how everything was working. I believe due to my high stress levels with work, family issues and personal issues, I fell behind. I took 4 different classes this Quarter which was a bit of an overload with all my priorites outside of school. Which reflected in my studies this quarter. Now we are reaching the end of the quarter I am doing okay in my classes but I know I could be doing better. This project is setting you up for what I learned taking Web Development 1. It was a hard process for me but I hope this website establishes what I can accomplish after taking this class. </p>
            
            <p>Enjoy!!</p>
